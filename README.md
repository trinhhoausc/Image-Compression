# Image-Compression
### An Implementation of the Daubechies Wavelets Algorithm using hybrid MPI/OpenMP
For compression ratio 16:1, structural similarity score is 0.94

For compression ratio 64:1, structural similarity score is 0.90

Benchmark results on different number of nodes and threads showed that with 4 processors and 4 threads per processors, the computing time is optimal.
